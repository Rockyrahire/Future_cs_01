# Future_cs_01
# Web Application Security Testing

## Overview

This project focuses on conducting security testing on a sample web application to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws. We will utilize tools like **OWASP ZAP**, **Burp Suite**, and **SQLMap** to test the application for security flaws.

## Tools Used

- **OWASP ZAP**: Automated vulnerability scanner for web applications.
- **SQLMap**: SQL injection testing tool.
- **Burp Suite**: Intercepting proxy for web application security testing.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install **OWASP ZAP** from [here](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/).
    - Install **SQLMap** from [here](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap).
    - Download **Burp Suite** from [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/community).

2. **Running SQLMap**:
    - Use the provided Python script to automate SQL injection tests with SQLMap.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      python sqlmap_script.py
      ```

3. **Running OWASP ZAP**:
    - Set up the **OWASP ZAP API** and run the provided Python script to scan for vulnerabilities such as XSS.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      python zap_script.py
      ```

4. **Generating the Report**:
    - The Python script will generate a detailed security report with identified vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      python generate_report.py
      ```

## Deliverables

- **Automated Testing Scripts**: Scripts to automate security testing using SQLMap, OWASP ZAP, and Burp Suite.
- **Security Report**: A detailed report outlining the identified vulnerabilities, risk levels, and remediation strategies.
