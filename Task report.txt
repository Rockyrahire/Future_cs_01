Sample Web Application Security Testing Report


Title: Web Application Security Testing Report

Author: [Sahebrao Shivaji Rahire

Date: [29 August 2025]

Version: 1.0   1. Introduction
1 purpose

This report documents the results of a security assessment conducted on a sample web application aimed at identifying vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws.

1.2 Scope

In-Scope: All publicly accessible endpoints, input parameters, and authentication flows of the sample app.

Out-of-Scope: Backend infrastructure or non-web components.

1.3 Methodology

Testing guided by OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) 
OWASP
.

Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, SQLMap, manual injection testing.

1.4 Limitations

Testing was limited to a point-in-time snapshot; new changes post-test could introduce new vulnerabilities 
OWASP
.

No source code or privileged access (gray-box or black-box methodology).

2. Executive Summary

Objective: Evaluate the sample application's security posture by detecting critical web vulnerabilities.

Key Findings:

SQL Injection (High Severity): Found in login parameter.

Reflected XSS (High Severity): Discovered in a search or feedback field.

Weak Session Management (Medium Severity): Session tokens are predictable and lack HttpOnly/Secure flags.

Overall Posture: The application exhibits high-severity flaws posing critical risks such as unauthorized data access, session hijacking, and remote exploitation. Immediate remediation is recommended.

3. Findings Summary
Ref.	Vulnerability	Severity	Affected Element
F-1	SQL Injection	High	Login input field
F-2	Reflected XSS	High	Search or feedback field
F-3	Weak Session Management	Medium	Session cookies
4. Findings Details
F-1: SQL Injection (Login Field)

Description: The username parameter in the login form is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing authentication bypass.

Impact: Attackers can log in as any user or extract database contents.

Severity: High

Proof of Concept:

Input ' OR '1'='1' -- in both username and password fields.

Authentication succeeds without valid credentials.

Mitigation: Use parameterized queries/prepared statements in the backend database layer.

F-2: Reflected XSS (Search Field)

Description: The search/feedback input displays user input unescaped in the response page.

Impact: Malicious JavaScript can be injected and executed, leading to session theft or phishing.

Severity: High 
Wikipedia

Proof of Concept:

Enter "><script>alert('XSS')</script> in the field.

The script executes upon rendering.

Mitigation: Implement proper HTML encoding and introduce Content Security Policy (CSP).

F-3: Weak Session Management

Description: Session ID values are predictable and stored without HttpOnly or Secure flags.

Impact: Vulnerable to session hijacking via XSS or packet sniffer.

Severity: Medium

Proof of Concept:

Observe session cookie via developer tools; token appears sequential (e.g., “sessionid=1001, 1002…”).

Mitigation: Generate secure random tokens; set cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite attributes.

5. Remediation Recommendations

F-1 (SQL Injection): Use prepared statements or ORM parameterization.

F-2 (XSS): Sanitize or encode outputs; deploy CSP headers to restrict scripts.

F-3 (Sessions): Use cryptographically secure token generation; enforce secure cookie flags; consider session rotation on login.

Strategic Advice: Adopt secure development practices, integrate automated scanning into CI/CD, and conduct regular security training and retesting.

6. Testing Methodology & Tools

Tools Used: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, SQLMap for detection and exploitation.

OWASP ZAP for automated scans and crawling.

Burp Suite's Repeater, Proxy, and Sequencer for manipulations

.

SQLMap to confirm injection points.

Approach: Manual and automated testing aligning with OWASP Top 10 and WSTG

.

7. Limitations

Full backend access was not available—testing relied on external inputs and visible responses.

Time constraints inhibited exhaustive testing.

8. Conclusion

The target web application contains serious security weaknesses—namely SQL injection and XSS—that pose high risks. Session handling is also inadequate. Immediate remediation is crucial. Revisiting security post-patches will ensure effectiveness and continued protection.

9. Appendices

A. Screenshots: Proof of SQL injection bypass, XSS alert pop-up, and raw session tokens seen in developer tools.

B. Tool Logs: Captured HTTP requests and SQLMap outputs.

C. Severity Definitions: (e.g., High = allows full compromise; Medium = moderate risk; Low = minor.)
